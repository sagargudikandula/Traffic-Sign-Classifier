Traffic signs play a significant role in managing the road traffic, avoiding any accidents, and ensuring safety by conveying different norms or rules that need to be followed on the road. There are several types of traffic signs like speed limits, no entry, traffic signals, turn to left or right, children crossing, no passing of heavy vehicles, etc. To make them easily readable and recognizable, traffic signs are often designed to be of a particular shape and color with symbols inside such that there is a significant difference between the sign and the background. Traffic sign classification is the process of identifying which class of a traffic sign.

In the automotive technology, employs ML enabled commercialized advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) which include traffic sign recognition as a part. With the increasing demand for the intelligence of vehicles, and the advent of self-driving cars, it is extremely necessary to detect and recognize traffic signs automatically through computer technology. For this, neural networks can be applied for analyzing images of traffic signs for cognitive decision-making by autonomous vehicles. Neural networks are the computing systems which act as a means of performing ML.

 In this work, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based ML model is built for recognition of traffic signs accurately for decision-making, when installed in driverless vehicles
